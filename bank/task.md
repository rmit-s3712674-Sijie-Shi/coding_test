CASH CODING EXERCISE V5
Guidelines
User your preferred oo language or functional language. Build a single bank by writing code with tests that meet the requirements along with a README. We expect you to spend between 2 to 3 hours on this exercise.
If you're spending longer than that you are probably over-engineering the solution. We review these anonymously to reduce bias; please don't put your name in the code or host it in a public place.
Requirements:
An example test scenario
When Alice deposits $30 and withdraws $20
Then Alice's balance will be $10 and the bank's balance will be $10
And Alice will be prevented from withdrawing $11 to prevent her balance going negative
What we're looking for:
• A concise and considered README that provides instructions and communicates your assumptions, design decisions and trade-offs. No novels please!
• Tests with good coverage of the app's behaviour that act as documentation for the code and includes the above example test scenario
• Your analysis of the above requirements and edge cases (please do not include anything outside these requirements!)
• A simple and extensible technical design that is maintainable and easily understandable by other engineers
• Code fluency and an idiomatic approach in your chosen coding language (any language is fine!)
What we're not looking for:
You don't need any way to interact with your code other than through tests. To help you focus on what we're interested in, don't spend time on:
• Code not needed to implement the requirements
• Command line tool
• User interface
• Any kind of server or client
• Persistence
• Multithreaded concurrency
